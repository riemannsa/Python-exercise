#A drunk pirate makes a random turn and then takes 100 steps forward, makes another random turn, takes another 100 steps, turns another random amount, etc. A social science student records the angle of each turn before the next 100 steps are taken. Her experimental data is [160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86]. (Positive angles are counter-clockwise.) Use a turtle to draw the path taken by our drunk friend.

import turtle
wn=turtle.Screen()
t=turtle.Turtle()

for i in [160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86]:
    t.right(i)
    t.forward(100)

#Enhance your program above to also tell us what the drunk pirateâ€™s heading is after he has finished stumbling around. (Assume he begins at heading 0).
